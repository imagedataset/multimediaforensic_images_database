TEST DATABASE FOR MEDIAN FILTERING DETECTION

This repository contains the test image database folders for different manipulations in images. 
These test databases can be used as a benchmark for image forensics.
Firstly, the image database folder named (CNN_model_test_images.zip) contains 500 images of 256x256 resolution size. 
The images are converted into RGB to Gary and further centrally cropped to sizes 
128x128, 64x64, and 32x32 for calculating the results for the following publications.

Secondly, the image database folder (SF_H_test_images.zip) contains a dummy image of the resolution 
2848x4288 of the RAISE dataset. For a full database please feel free to contact us at aanchalagarwal2@gmail.com. 
This dataset is used to compile the results for the publication.

For using as a benchhmarking, images should be centrally cropped
